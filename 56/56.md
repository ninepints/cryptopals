# 56: RC4 Single-Byte Biases

## Running the solution

```
runhaskell 56/56.hs
```

Requires package [cryptonite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite)

This one takes a while, requiring 2^26 samples (RC4 encryptions) to recover two bytes, and it isn't always perfect. Increasing the sample count improves accuracy at the cost of taking even longer.
