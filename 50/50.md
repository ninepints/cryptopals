# 50: Hashing with CBC-MAC

Because the cipher key is public, we can encrypt whatever we want in CBC mode, then XOR the last output block with the first block of the original input. (whatever-we-want || altered-input) will yield the same result as the original input.

## Running the solution

```
runhaskell 50/50.hs
```

Requires package [cryptonite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite)
