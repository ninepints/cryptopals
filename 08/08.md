# 8: Detect AES in ECB mode

In this exercise, we're tasked with finding the AES-ECB ciphertext in a group of strings. Because the same input block will always produce the same output block under the same key in ECB mode, we look for a ciphertext containing repeated blocks.

## Running the solution

```
runhaskell 08/08.hs 08/8.txt
```
