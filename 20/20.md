# 20: Break fixed-nonce CTR statistically

If we truncate each ciphertext to the length of the shortest, then concatenate them, the result can be passed to our repeating-key XOR code from exercise 6.

## Running the solution

```
runhaskell 20/20.hs 20.20.txt
```

Requires package [cryptonite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite)

This and exercise 19 are two approaches to the same problem, so either input file will work with either solution.
