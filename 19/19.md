# 19: Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitutions

Because the keystream is shared by all the ciphertexts, we have lots of context we can use to guess each successive key byte.

We can guess the first couple bytes by choosing bytes that yield letters when combined with the ciphertexts. (Plaintext bytes are unlikely to be control characters, punctuation, etc.) The rest is even easier: any index >= 2 probably puts us partway through a word in at least one plaintext, so we can infer the next plaintext byte from our knowledge of how to spell things.

## Running the solution

```
runhaskell 19/19.hs 19.19.txt
```

Requires package [cryptonite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite)

The program will display a grid of bytes. The first row indicates the current keystream, and subsequent rows show the ciphertexts combined with the current keystream. Initially, the keystream is all zeros. Use the "s" and "w" keys to increment and decrement the first keystream byte, and the "d" and "a" keys to move forward and backwards in the keystream. Press "q" to exit.

This and exercise 20 are two approaches to the same problem, so either input file will work with either solution. Pass the `--easyMode` option after the filename to reorder the guesses for each key byte, similar to exercise 20. Bytes that yield plaintext closest to English will come first.
