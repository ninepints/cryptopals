# Cryptopals

These are my solutions to the [Matasano crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com), a series of programming exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world cryptography. They're also my first time writing Haskell! I'm still picking up the language, so things might be a bit of a mess.

Each exercise has its own numbered directory that holds a driver program and any implementation notes. The driver usually takes no arguments: for example, you can run the first solution with `runhaskell 01/01.hs`.
