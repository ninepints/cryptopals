# 31: Implement and break HMAC-SHA1 with an artificial timing leak

## Running the solution

Requires packages

[snap](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snap)

`runhaskell 31/server.hs <delay>` will start a server with a short-circuiting bytestring comparison function. After comparing each pair of bytes, the server sleeps for the given number of milliseconds.

`runhaskell 31/31.hs <guessesPerByte>` will try to recover a HMAC by measuring how long the server takes to respond to various guesses. For each HMAC byte index and possible byte, it will make the given number of requests, then take the guessed byte with the greatest median response time.
