# 28: Implement a SHA-1 keyed MAC

The driver doesn't actually do anything with secret-prefix MACs, but it does hash some test values to verify the hash function implementation. Obviously, hashing two run-of-the-mill messages with a secret prefix will yield different output.

## Running the solution

```
runhaskell 28/28.hs [MD4|SHA1]
```
