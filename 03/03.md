# 3: Single-byte XOR cipher

In this challenge, the input string has been XOR-ed with a single repeated byte. To find the original message, we XOR the input with all 256 possible bytes, then choose the result that most closely resembles English. Closeness to English is determined by stripping spaces, converting to lowercase, and then comparing character frequencies with the typical character frequencies of English text.
