# 24: Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it

## Running the solution

`runhaskell 24/testSketchyCtr.hs` verifies that the stream cipher works as expected.

`runhaskell 24/seed.hs` will seed a generator with a random 16-bit value and use it to mask a string of 'A' characters. `runhaskell 24/guess.hs <output>` will guess the seed given the output of `seed.hs`.
